## User Preferences
I want the agent to use simple language and provide detailed explanations when necessary. I prefer an iterative development approach, where I can review changes frequently. The agent should ask for confirmation before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Color Scheme:** Primary Milwaukee Red (`hsl(0, 72%, 42%)`), with black/white foreground and subtle card backgrounds.
- **Typography:** Space Grotesk for headings, Inter for body text.
