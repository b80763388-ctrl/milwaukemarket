# Milwaukee Tools - Sklep z NarzÄ™dziami Powystawowymi

## Overview
This project is a professional, bilingual (Polish/English) e-commerce store offering original Milwaukee exhibition tools with a 12-month warranty. The platform aims to provide a seamless shopping experience through a modern UI, real-time chat support, and robust e-commerce functionalities, targeting customers seeking high-quality tools at attractive prices.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Bilingual support (PL/EN) with automatic IP-based language detection.
- Full e-commerce workflow: product display, cart, checkout, order placement.
- Real-time customer support via live chat.
- Admin panel for managing orders and customer chats.
- Responsive design across devices.

## User Preferences
I want the agent to use simple language and provide detailed explanations when necessary. I prefer an iterative development approach, where I can review changes frequently. The agent should ask for confirmation before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies.

## System Architecture
